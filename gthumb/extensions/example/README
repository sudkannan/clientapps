This is an example extension that can be used as a starting point to develop 
a new extension.

For example to create a flickr uploader extension, open a terminal and issue 
the following commands:

cp -R example ~/gthumb-flickr-uploader
cd ~/gthumb-flickr-uploader
sh init.sh flickr-uploader

and remember to modify the extension description in 
src/flickr_uploader.extension.in.in

at this point the extension is ready to be compiled with the usual commands:

./autogen.sh --prefix=SAME_GTHUMB_PREFIX
make
sudo make install

After installing the extension, start gthumb and activate it with the
Edit->Extensions command.

If you think your extension can be useful to others as well, add it to
the extensions list available at http://live.gnome.org/gthumb/extensions

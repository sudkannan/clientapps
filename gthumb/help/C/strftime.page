  <p>Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding
  the conversion specifier character by the E or O modifier to
  indicate that an alternative format should be used. If the
  alternative format or specification does not exist for the
  current locale, the behaviour will be as if the unmodified
  conversion specification were used. The Single Unix Specification
  mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey, %EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om,
  %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW, %Oy, where the effect of the O
  modifier is to use alternative numeric symbols (say, roman
  numerals), and that of the E modifier is to use a
  locale-dependent alternative representation.</p>
